# Twilio And Pusher Project

## This is a basic project that leverages the power of Twilio and Pusher to build real-time applications. The following was done for this project.

- Update users in real time when actions are performed or information is available.
- Provision and program telephone numbers for a range of users, including inbound calls and phone number masking for online marketplaces.
- Verify your user's phone numbers and perform 2-factor authentication by sending a verification call or SMS message.
- Build innovative IVR systems to route users to the correct part of your phone.
- Give your users instant real-time feedback on screen to show how they are progressing through their offscreen processes.
- Initiate phone calls to connect your support team with your end user.
- User composer to effectively manage the Pusher and Twilio SDKs in one go.
- Set up conference rooms, with support for PIN code access and moderators who can start and end the conference.
